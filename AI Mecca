  \]
  \[
  \theta_t = \theta_{t-1} - \alpha \frac{\hat{m}_t}{\sqrt{\hat{v}_t} + \epsilon}

### 4. Robust Communication Mechanisms

#### Message Queues
- **Kafka, RabbitMQ**: Employing message queues for asynchronous communication between modules helps manage load and ensures reliable message delivery.
  - **Example**: A data ingestion module publishes messages to a Kafka topic, and a data processing module subscribes to that topic to receive data for processing.

#### Pub/Sub Systems
- **Google Pub/Sub, AWS SNS/SQS**: Use publish-subscribe systems to decouple modules and handle communication in a scalable manner.
  - **Example**: A data analytics service publishes results to a topic, and multiple downstream services subscribe to that topic to receive updates.

### 5. Error Handling and Recovery

#### Centralized Logging
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized logging systems like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Splunk aggregate logs from all modules, making it easier to monitor and debug.
  - **Example**: Logs from all microservices are collected in Elasticsearch, and Kibana dashboards provide real-time monitoring and alerting.

#### Retry Mechanisms
- **Idempotent Operations**: Ensure that operations can be safely retried without causing unintended side effects.
  - **Example**: A data update operation that can be executed multiple times without changing the final outcome.

### 6. Version Control and Configuration Management

#### Versioned APIs
