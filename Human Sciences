This essay is divided into six sections: Introduction, What to Avoid, What you should Drink, What to Eat, When to Eat/Fasting, and Supplements. I've included pictures of all the food products I recommend you buy. A number or letter will appear next to products mentioned in this format: Prana(A) Pukka(1) Rolling Meadow(2)... All the pictures in this email are named after each number/letter reference. There are exceptions like the water brands I mentioned. Lookup any brand that doesn't have a number/letter or picture along with it. 
Section 1 - Introduction
I've studied several books on health, diet, and food. I want to first explain what I think is wrong with the food system and why conventional food isn't good for your health and why only organic food is good for you. Food is the most valuable resource to humans, without good food we simply can't live. 
In the last 200 years, the production, manufacturing, and processing methods we've developed to increase our food supply and its shelf life, have also destroyed our food's nutritional value and contaminated it with toxic chemicals and compounds. 
Let's look at an example, an apple. Imagine I took an heirloom apple seed to a remote part of the world that can grow apples well and planted that seed. The apple tree would grow naturally and produce mineral-rich, nutrient-dense apples. These apples are good for your health and taste very good. 
Now let's look at how most apples are produced through modern agricultural practices. We start with a genetically modified seed (GMO), then plant it in soil that's been minerally depleted. The GMO seed will probably be designed to grow apples much quicker than normal. The apples may be designed to grow and look a certain way, or the apple will produce pesticides inside from its modification. Because the seed was planted in minerally depleted soil, toxic chemical fertilizers will be required to grow the tree which further erodes the soil. Soil erosion is a big environmental problem in our world... much bigger than climate change and nobody is talking about it or doing anything about it. 
Now let's say the apples are owned by a big company that wants to produce as much 'product' as quickly as possible. Once the apples begin to grow, they will be sprayed with toxic chemical pesticides and herbicides. They do this so they can save as many apples that grow for sale to the public. To save more time and make more money, the apples are picked unripened and are artificially ripened through chemical injections or radiation exposure. 
Now, if I was to put both types of apples side by side, the naked eye wouldn't be able to tell a difference because the GMO apples are designed to look normal. However, one apple is full of live enzymes, minerals and is nutrient-dense. While the other has very little nutrition left in it and is full of toxic chemicals. If you ate both apples, the organic one would taste very good, and the conventional apple wouldn't have any taste in it. 
Such low-quality food is unfit for human consumption, and I believe is one of the main reasons why so many people today are plagued with all the diseases and medical problems we suffer from. This is why it's so important that we reject our modern food production methods, and go back to a more natural way of producing food. 
We must reject GMOs, pesticides, and herbicides. We must reject methods that contribute to soil erosion, and we must reject the use of artificial ripening. 
The good news is there are many farms and food companies that are switching to making only high-quality organic food that is good for your health. This food is more difficult to produce and takes more time, that's why it is more expensive. However, any food that was produced organically tastes much better and is good for your health instead of being bad for you.  
How low-quality food affects weight gain: Your body needs complete nutrition to function at 100%. When you eat food that doesn't have a lot of nutrition, your body begins to store fat so it can use it for energy later on. Only when the food you're eating has good nutrition, does your body burn fat and not store it. You don't need to store fat for later on because your body is getting all the nutrition it needs with the food you're eating. This is why eating high-quality food that has lots of nutrition is essential for maintaining low body fat. This is also why you can eat food like butter, gluten-free pasta, eggs, potatoes, meat and still lose weight. You just have to make sure it's all organic and cooked at home. 
I want to break down what nutrition we need in our bodies and all the food that makes you healthy. The seven main macronutrients are Proteins, Carbohydrates, Fats, Vitamins, Minerals, Fiber, and Water. You need to eat all to have a complete diet, but there are more details along with it. 
You also need to consume the complete list of nutrients that your body needs. This includes: 
All the bioactive minerals like calcium, magnesium, zinc, etc. 
Amino Acids, which are the building blocks for proteins. 
The anti-oxidant vitamins like A, B, C, D, E. Essential fatty acids (EFA's), like Omega-3, 6, and 9. Other powerful antioxidants like Astaxanthin and Glutathione. 
The only way to know if you are getting all these nutrients is by taking the supplements I recommended. You don't know if you will give your body everything it needs from the food you're eating and the supplements will always complete the list. 
You also need good cholesterol for your body to get complete nutrition. The best source of cholesterol is eggs, and organic free-run brown eggs have the most nutrition in them. Making those eggs with grass-fed butter is very healthy for you and will help you lose weight and taste very good. I believe eggs are an essential part of a complete diet. 
The other elements of the diet that are important are taking enough digestive enzymes and probiotics. Enzymes are found in raw fruits and vegetables, when you cook food the enzymes are destroyed so I like to take a supplement when I'm eating a cooked meal. You don't need enzymes when you're eating raw food like salads, smoothies, or fruit. Those foods have lots of natural enzymes in them. Natural enzymes can also be found in organic unfiltered apple cider vinegar with "Mother". Mother is the bacteria culture used to ferment the apple cider into vinegar. You can drink tablespoons of vinegar or add it to any desirable food. One of the best brands for apple cider vinegar is Omega Nutrition(A). 
Probiotics are found in fermented food like pickles, kimchi, sauerkraut, miso, and fermented drinks like kombucha. Probiotics are also found in yogurt and kefir, but I'm not going to include any milk products in your diet (except for butter) and I would recommend not drinking any milk or eating any milk products for the duration of your diet. Once you lose your weight you can go back to eating high-quality organic cheese and organic yogurt if you want. You can also supplement probiotics which I prefer to do especially if my meals don't have any fermented food in them. 
I'm not going into details about all the diets I've tried and the ones that are out there because there is so much information and you don't need to learn everything right away. I'm simply going to give you a list of the types of food you should not touch at all, and a list of all the types of food you should be eating. The good news is you won't be restricted to only eating salads, fruits, and smoothies. I believe only eating that type of food, which is considered very healthy, doesn't give your body all the nutrition that it needs. 
Section 2 - Foods to avoid
The most obvious types of food you should avoid are sweets and processed junk food: Donuts, chocolate bars, ice cream, cookies, cakes, Pies, muffins, desserts, candy, potato chips, hot dogs, fried food, pizza, any packaged food that's a snack, frozen food, etc. If you get a craving for really sweet food the best thing to eat are fruits like mango/pineapple or organic figs and "Prana Medjool Dates"(1).
The good news is once you lost weight, they have organic junk food if you really want to eat it again. Something like "Giddy Yoyo dark mint chocolate"(2), is something you can eat right now as part of this diet, eat it every day, and it will be healthy for you. It's not sweet and a little bitter, but tastes really good and has a nice mint flavor. I sometimes get a craving for cookies and I'll buy a box of my favorite organic cookies once every few months. After you lost weight it's ok to eat a little bit of junk food every few months. 
I would avoid any food that comes from a restaurant. Almost all restaurants use lower-quality food to save money and only expensive fancy restaurants serve organic meals. You're always better off making your own food and taking it with you if you have to go out. The only exception I'd make for restaurant food is sushi. If you want to eat at a sushi restaurant that's ok. The only thing I recommend not getting at a sushi restaurant is any tempura or cooked meat. They use low-quality oil for the tempura and the beef and chicken they use is low-quality as well. Most items at a sushi restaurant are good for you: Green tea, Miso soup, salads, and the sashimi and sushi are all healthy as long as they don't have tempura in them! 
This leads to the other type of food you should avoid which is anything cooked with any type of oil. The problem with oil is that once you heat it, toxic compounds are formed that are bad for your health and the oil becomes rancid. If you keep using the oil, it changes color and becomes very smelly. This is what rancid oil is and any food that's cooked with it is bad for your health. Even coconut oil becomes rancid and is bad for your health! Because I explained why oil is bad, you should only cook your food with grass-fed butter or organic ghee. Butter and ghee don't become rancid when you heat them and have lots of good fat and healthy nutrition that your body needs. Thinking that eating butter will make you fat is an old myth that's been scientifically proven wrong, it does the opposite effect and helps you lose weight. The problem is most companies use cheap low-quality milk that's contaminated to make their butter. Companies like Gay Lea and other regular brands make this cheap butter that isn't the best for your health, and it even tastes a little weird. This is why you have to buy organic grass-fed butter because it's clean, it's good for your health and tastes very good and creamy. My favorite brand is "Rolling Meadow Butter Unsalted(3)". You can also use any organic Ghee brand(4). Make sure it says "organic". The problem with ghee is it can be expensive even compared to butter. Some containers are $20 or more! If you can find a cheap brand that's still organic I would buy that. Anything around $10 is ok but $15 or more is pretty expensive. It will be your choice and decision what is more worth it and cheaper, the ghee or butter? I prefer to only use butter because they only sell expensive ghee at my grocery store, Fortino's might have a cheaper brand. 
I would also recommend that you keep your diet gluten-free. Gluten is a hard-to-digest protein that slows down your metabolism when you eat it. Any food that slows your metabolism will prevent you from losing weight, that's why it's essential to eliminate it. Gluten is primarily found in wheat, barley, and rye. Many foods can be made from these ingredients like bread, baked goods, pasta, cereal, sauces, salad dressing, canned soups, malt, beer, yeast, etc. Do not include any of these foods made from wheat, barley, or rye in your diet. 
The other food I would avoid is any meat that is not from Blossom Pure. Most meat that is available is low-quality and not worth eating. I don't want to get into details there is a lot of information about the meat industry and why it's a problem. I would suggest watching movies like Food Inc. or Fast Food Nation that go deeper into this subject. Blossom Pure only sells clean organic meat and anytime I want to buy and eat meat for myself, I will only buy it from there. The owner is Muslim and all their meat is also Halal.  
Summary - Foods to avoid: 
Donuts, chocolate bars, ice cream, cookies, cakes, pies, muffins, desserts, candy, potato chips, hot dogs, pizza, restaurant food except sushi. Anything cooked with any type of oil. Any food that contains gluten in it. Avoid any dairy products like milk, yogurt, and cheese, except grass-fed butter, which is an essential part of this diet. Any meat that is not from Blossom Pure. 
Section 3 - What you should Drink
I'll start by recommending what you should be drinking. You should drink plenty of water during the day. Water isn't as simple as it seems and is more complex than most people think. The best water you can drink is water directly from a spring that's been bottled in a glass container. Almost all spring water is bottled in plastic bottles and becomes dirty water by the time you drink it. The main reason for this is because the plastic in the bottles contain BPA (look it up more on the internet) and other toxic chemicals which leech into water, especially during transportation where the bottles become hot. By the time the water reaches you, it has become contaminated with the chemicals from the plastic and doesn't taste good anymore, and is not healthy for you. This is why if you choose to buy spring water, you should only buy a brand that comes in glass containers. There are a few brands available at grocery stores like Voss, Fiuggi, San Benedetto, San Pellegrino, and Eska. They all sell mineral water in glass bottles. Just make sure you buy the mineral water and not the sparkling water. Sparkling water also known as 'club soda' is carbonated water to make it more like soda pop. It's not refreshing to drink and you should only be drinking mineral spring water, not sparkling water. Buying individual glass spring bottles can be expensive if each bottle is $3-$4 or more. Some brands are only $2 for 1 liter which is more reasonable. Some brands you might not like the taste and other brands might taste better, try the different brands and buy the one you like the best. Just make sure it's only from glass bottles and is mineral water, not sparkling water. Another alternative is to buy bulk water in glass containers. Cedar Springs sells such a product: https://cedarspringswater.ca/glass/
And My Water Bearer sells in bulk as well:
https://www.mywaterbearer.com/
The worst water to drink is unfiltered tap water. City water is loaded with chemicals like fluoride and chlorine to kill bacteria. The problem is these chemicals stay in the water and we consume them if you drink unfiltered tap water. If you have a water filtration system at home, that water is also ok to drink. The problem with filtered water is that it loses its electrolytes during the filtration process. It's recommended that you add electrolytes to such water to make it healthy again. There are different ways to do this: add a pinch of pink salt, or drop of apple cider vinegar, or add a product designed to add electrolytes to your water. I've tried all these methods and the problem I have with them is the water is ok but it doesn't taste refreshing or natural. Natural fresh spring water by comparison tastes much better and is more refreshing to drink. The problem is it will be more expensive to keep buying it, so I would recommend trying the different types of water, and deciding for yourself which one you like best that you can afford to buy. How you drink your water and how much depends on you. If you feel like drinking lots of water then do it, if you feel like drinking less don't force yourself to drink too much. Some people like warm water, some people like ice cold, drink your preference. Sometimes we have busy lives and forget to drink enough liquids during the day. Be more conscious about this and remember to drink more liquids during the day. I prefer not to drink water by itself and only like drinking it when I'm eating a big cooked meal. I also only like drinking my water ice cold. 
What else you should drink: Healthy Teas, Kombucha, Juices/Smoothies. 
When you feel like having a hot drink, the best thing you can drink is Matcha Tea or Green Tea. Matcha tea is a superior concentrated form of green tea. There are different types of matcha and some can be very expensive. If you can find a cheap matcha tea I still think it's better than any regular green tea out there. If you can't find cheap matcha and don't want to buy an expensive one then just buy a good quality organic green tea. Organic green tea is still better than any other tea available, just don't buy Lipton green tea or another cheap brand. Lipton green tea is the worst!. My favorite tea brand is Pukka(5) they're matcha tea isn't so expensive and is of good quality. They also sell Tulsi(5a) tea which is another type of tea worth buying and drinking. If you find another brand that sells organic Tulsi tea, it might be worth buying and trying it out. The third type of tea that is very healthy to drink is Yerba Mate. It's from South America and is different from the other two. I notice when I drink Yerba Mate, it gives me lots of energy similar to coffee but you don't get that 'wired up' feeling. Green tea and Tulsi tea by comparison have more of a relaxing effect, so drink according to what effect you want from the tea. Yerba Mate can be expensive so if you can find a cheap brand get it, even the cheap brands are pretty good and worth buying. Don't buy any Yerba Mate drink in a can, try to find the actual tea and make it yourself. If you don't like the taste of any of these teas by themselves, it's ok to add a little bit of honey to make them a little sweet. 
Kombucha is probably my favorite drink of all time. It's carbonated like soda pop but it's completely natural, organic, and good for your health. Out of all the foods that I've tried, Kombucha might have the most health benefits for you. It fixes any problems with your digestive system. If you've eaten bad food it will clean up your system and help you digest the bad food. It gives you lots of energy when you drink it, and can even be a meal replacement. Drinking one bottle can keep your hunger away for several hours even half a day or longer. I've been drinking it for years and I'm still amazed how much benefit it gives my health that I drink at least one bottle every day and sometimes drink 2. The best brand is "GT's Synergy"(6). My favorite flavors are Gingerberry and Mystic Mango, Rose Berry, and Pomegranate Power. Other good flavors are Trilogy, Guava Goddess, Divine Grape, Cosmic Cranberry. You can try all the different flavors if you want and see which one you like. The ones that are less tasty are Mojito and Muti-Green, I don't like those flavors. 
The third thing I'd recommend to drink is homemade juices and smoothies. If you have a juicer at home you can make juice from any organic fruit you buy single fruit or mixed. You can also make a vegetable juice like V8 if you want. Just don't ever buy any bottled or canned juice product. Juice has very sensitive nutrition and is only good for you when it's freshly juiced and is consumed right away. Any juice that sits around for a long time loses its nutrition and flavor. This is why all canned or bottled juices/smoothies are not worth buying and you should only drink freshly squeezed juice or blended smoothies. My favorite type of juice is homemade carrot juice from organic carrots with a little bit of ginger added. 
The other form of drink is making a smoothie in a blender, It can be fruit or vegetable mix. You can add things like dates to make it sweeter, or chia seeds to add protein and omega-3. Even adding crushed nuts like almonds and Cashews adds flavor to smoothies. You can look up many recipes online or come up with your own creative ideas for smoothies. The problem with making these awesome smoothies is that getting all the ingredients for them can be very expensive especially if you're only buying organic. Try making them a couple of times, but you have to decide how much you like it, and is it worth the amount of money it costs to make. Another alternative especially if you're not at home, is getting a juice or smoothie from Booster Juice or any other Juice/Smoothie Bar. Just don't buy any drink that has milk or yogurt in it. Check the ingredients for the smoothies and only buy flavors that don't contain milk or yogurt. Booster Juice isn't organic but it's ok to drink and much better than coffee, soda, or energy drinks which are all bad for your health. If you really like smoothies and think making homemade organic ones are too expensive, then Booster Juice is a cheap alternative that is also ok to drink. The closest Booster Juices are Hwy 27 by Walmart north of Zenway and inside Humber College. 
At the beginning of the section, I mentioned that you should drink plenty of water throughout the day. Tea, Smoothies, Juices, and Kombucha are all mostly made of water and you still get the water you need from having these other drinks, so always keep that in mind. You can't drink everything: 1 liter of water or more, a bottle of Kombucha, Cups of teas, A glass of Juice or Smoothie every day. You have to pick and choose what you will drink on any particular day and how much you drink. Some days you might feel like drinking more water or juice. Somedays you don't want to drink a smoothie or cup of tea. You don't have to drink everything all the time and can drink more and less of whatever you like. I personally don't drink many smoothies or cups of tea. I mainly only drink Kombucha and water. You might be the opposite and only like smoothies and teas. Take your time to try the different healthy drinks and find the ones you like the best. I would try to aim for drinking at least 1.5 liters of liquid a day and probably 2 liters or more. Some days you'll feel like drinking more and some days less. But I would try to aim for 1.5-2 liters a day. Some days if you feel like drinking less I would try to drink at least 1 liter. 
Summary of What you should Drink:
Never drink unfiltered tap water. Add electrolytes to filtered water. The best water is fresh spring water in a glass container. Be conscious about drinking plenty of liquids throughout the day. Matcha, Green Tea, Tulsi, and Yerba Mate are the best teas to drink. Add a little bit of honey if you want to sweeten the tea. The best brand of Kombucha is GT's Synergy, drink as much as you want. Make juices and smoothies fresh at home with organic produce. Booster Juice is an ok substitute. Try to drink 1.5-2 liters of liquid per day. 
Section 4 - Foods to Eat
Any organic fresh produce available at Fortino's is good to eat. This includes all fruits and vegetables. I already explained why organic is much better than conventional so make sure you're only buying organic vegetables and fruits and not conventional. 
You can add the produce to any dish you want to make and eat. For example, you can make a vegetable sabzi with butter or ghee and that's good to eat. You can make a healthy meat sabzi as well, just make sure you only use meat from Blossom Pure and only cook with grass-fed butter or ghee.
Don't eat any roti made from wheat flour. You can eat corn flour roti (Maki), but that doesn't taste very good. You can also eat roti made from a mix of gluten-free flour like chickpea flour mixed with potato starch and cornmeal. Roti's made from these mixed flours taste better and have more nutrition in them and are gluten-free. Indian food can be healthy, you just have to use mixed gluten-free flour for roti's, and cook all the sabzis with ghee or butter instead of oil.    
The next food I'm going to talk about is a very important staple for a weight loss diet plan and that's a high-quality organic salad. I don't each much salad anymore, but if you want to lose weight or detox your body, salad is an excellent food to eat daily. Not all salads are healthy. You can add processed salad dressing, low-quality cheese, and meat which can make a salad very unhealthy. This is why you must know what are the right ingredients to add to salad and keep it very healthy. First, you must decide on what type of green you want to use. Most people pick lettuce but that's not the only choice you have. You can make the salad more healthy by using kale instead. Even though kale is considered very healthy and nutritious, I don't think it's ideal for a weight loss diet. Kale is very hard and tough compared to other greens. The cell walls are much thicker and stronger compared to other greens, that's why it has such a hard texture. Thicker and stronger cell walls are harder to digest and will slow down your metabolism. Once you lose weight and your metabolism becomes more efficient, you can start eating kale if you want but in the meantime, it's better to avoid any food that is hard to digest. My favorite green to use in salad is spinach. Spinach is very healthy and is much softer in texture because the cell walls aren't so thick and are easier to digest. Other good greens to put in a salad are broccoli leaves, chard, endive, watercress, radicchio, Arugula, and any lettuce. The more greens you can mix into your salad the more nutrition and variety it will have. Fortino's sells "PC Organics Mixed Field Greens/Spinach"(7,8) for salad. Or you can buy the greens separately and mix them yourself(9,10). Once you decided what greens you want you can start adding other ingredients: tomatoes, cucumber, olives: organic kalamata are the best(11), sliced green pepper, celery, "Sunshine Farms Dill Pickles"(12) is the best tasting pickles I've ever tried, they're expensive but worth the price. You can add parsley, dill, green beans, capers, chives, sundried tomatoes, grilled Eggplant, pumpkin seeds, crushed walnuts, crushed "Organic Traditions Cashews"(13), crushed "Mike and Mike's Raw Almonds"(14), lemon, "Prana Ground Chia Seeds"(15), Organic Kidney Beans(16), Black Beans(17) or Chickpeas(18), you can also add cooked Quinoa as part of your salad or eat it on its own or add to another dish(19,20). For dressing, I would recommend making your own. you can add it directly to the salad or mix it in a bowl and add it on after. Start with some olive oil. This is the only time it is ok to use some oil in your diet but don't use too much. You're not cooking with the oil so it doesn't become rancid. Mix spices of your choice into the oil: pink crystal salt, black pepper, cumin, turmeric, coriander, garlic, ginger, cardamom seeds, apple cider vinegar, balsamic vinegar, etc. Once you have all the ingredients and dressing on, mix it all up and enjoy! You can be creative and add any other ingredients I didn't mention. You can add fruits like berries and mango slices and make a salad with fruit in it, and modify the dressing where you add cinnamon instead of other spices. Or you can add healthy meat ingredients even seafood like shrimp and salmon and make a salty salad. You can mix and match so many different ingredients and make so many different salads that taste different. Experiment and come up with amazing salads that taste good and are healthy for you! 
Eating only salads and drinking only smoothies and teas is good for your health and helps you lose weight very quickly. However, you don't get complete nutrition, and eventually, you'll get cravings for cooked food, even greasy food or sugar cravings. The next types of food will give your body the complete nutrition it needs and will help prevent cravings for bad food. 
If you want to eat pasta you can, just make sure it's gluten-free and you use an organic tomato sauce(21,22,23,24,25). Instead of being made from wheat, gluten-free pasta is made from corn, rice, quinoa, chickpeas, or lentils. These pastas have more nutrition than wheat pasta and taste better and more hearty. There are different brands of organic pasta sauce that you can buy. Some of them are expensive costing $8-$10 per container. They have cheap brands like "PC Organics"(26), that sell for around $5-$6. In my experience, the expensive brands don't taste any better than the cheap ones. You still need to add your own vegetables, meat, and spices to make it taste good. So it's not worth buying expensive pasta sauce and it's ok to just buy the cheapest organic sauce they have. How good the pasta tastes will depend on what other ingredients and spices you put in yourself. 
An important part of the diet is eating high-quality starchy foods like Potatoes and Rice. My favorite potatoes to eat are yellow or white potatoes followed by red potatoes. Russet is my least favorite, however, russet are the best potatoes for making french fries and potato wedges. You can make potatoes any way you want but if you're going to fry them don't use any oil, either use ghee or an air fryer. My favorite potato dish is yellow mashed potatoes. I'll add butter, my own spices, kimchi, "Sunflower Kitchen Hummus"(27), horseradish, broth. I like to mix an egg into the potato and make a mix of scrambled eggs and mashed potatoes... I love this dish! They have organic potatoes available at Fortino's(28,29). 
The other starchy food you should eat is rice. Rice is a quality nutrient-dense, easy to digest, gluten-free grain. Like any food out there, the conventional rice brands aren't the best for your health. The rice is always white and it's been produced in a way where a lot of its nutrition gets lost. Regular white rice isn't the worst. I would prefer to eat it over any other food when I was in India. The problem is when you compare it to Organic Brown Basmati Rice"(30), it is an inferior rice. Organic rice tastes better, fills you up quicker, and is easier to digest because it has more fiber. I also like to make my rice by adding some "Bio-Bud Sprouted Lentils"(31). 
You can also add the lentils to any other dish you want or can make Indian-style dal if you like that. Just remember to use everything organic and only use ghee or butter.
Why are potatoes and rice so important? Eating plenty of potatoes and rice will cover all your carbohydrate and starchy food needs. Out of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates, your body will burn the carbs and use them for energy and give them priority over fats and proteins. Try this experiment, look at a picture of a green salad. Then look at a picture of crispy golden french fries. Which food looks better and tastier to eat? The answer is the french fries of course! Why is that? Isn't salad healthier and shouldn't I want that more? The reason why is your body will prefer to get its energy from starchy food over green food. Throughout your diet, you might start feeling like you want to eat more starchy food over greens. If you stop eating salads and greens and only start eating eggs and potatoes/rice that's ok too and you can lose weight eating that food. The final reason why starch is important is because it gets rid of any sweet tooth cravings you have. Starch is a complex form of sugars and carbs. When you don't eat enough starch, you get cravings for sweet food. Anything sweet contains simple sugars that your body can quickly break down use right away. The problem is sweets don't have any other nutrients in them and can't sustain proper health. Starch by comparison is a complete carbohydrate. Your body burns through it slowly and it provides sustained energy for hours. This is why a meal full of potatoes and rice is so filling and can keep you full for most of the day. When you slowly burn carbs and eat less, you burn more fat. 
The final starchy food you could add to your diet is bread. Regular bread contains gluten and should be avoided. The problem with gluten-free bread is it doesn't taste very good. There is only one company I was able to find that makes tasty gluten-free bread: "Little Northern Bakehouse"(32). My favorite flavor is 'Sprouted Seven Grain' but I would say all of their breads taste good. You don't have to eat bread if you don't like it. I enjoy eating bread with homemade soup and eggs. I like the crunchy texture of toasted bread, it goes well with different food that I eat. I'll spread some butter and hummus and the bread and it will taste amazing! 
Another thing I want to mention is eating food that has different textures to them. Sometimes I want a meal that's mostly water, like soup. Sometimes I want soft food like mashed potatoes, sometimes I want crunchy food like toasted bread. I don't know the exact science behind it, but I believe in satisfying your craving for soft and crunchy foods. 
Another crunchy food that's good to eat is "Neal Brothers Organic Blue+Flax Tortillas(33). You can also buy organic salsa(34,35) and it will make a great crunchy snack. If you want to make full Nacho's you can do that do. You can add whatever toppings you want but I wouldn't put any cheese on it. Some people like me, think nachos need to have cheese on them otherwise they don't taste as good. If you insist on putting cheese on your nachos I would recommend only using the "Arla"(36) brand. Don't put so much cheese on them and only eat cheese once in a while if you insist on eating it. Remember that eating cheese makes you gain weight. I remember a few years ago I bought so many types of cheese at once because I wanted to taste them all. I was mostly eating cheese and I gained 10 pounds in one week! If I want to gain weight I know exactly what I should be eating... cheese! 
A staple food that I think you should eat regularly is eggs. I mentioned earlier why you need good cholesterol, and organic free-run brown eggs(37,38) are the best to eat. I don't like eating boiled eggs. The whites and yokes become hard compared to other ways you can cook them and they don't taste very good. The best way to cook eggs is with butter or ghee. There are many more different ways you can prepare the eggs in a pan with butter and they will taste 100 times better! Eating eggs cooked in butter is also much healthier for you than hard-boiled eggs. I normally don't eat eggs by themselves, I'll cook them alongside my potatoes or rice and like to eat them with toast. 
Another food I will recommend to you is noodles as stir fry or in a broth soup. If you want to make stir-fry noodles I would recommend only use ghee or butter and only use gluten-free noodles. My favorite brand of noodles is "Lotus Foods Jade Pearl Rice Ramen"(39). It's expensive so if you want to make lots of noodles, any gluten-free product will work fine. 
Another food that is very good for your health and tasty is homemade boiled broth. Broth takes a long time to make, 8-12 hours so it's not practical to make it all the time. However, if you want to eat the best soup or have the best bowl of noodles. You need to make your own broth at home. There are many good broth recipes you can find online, and I would only recommend getting the meat bones from Blossom Pure. Once the broth is made I like to boil the noodles in it and add my own veggies and spices. I'll add some miso soup mix and drop a couple of eggs in it. Very filling and satisfying meal. 
The final thing I want to talk about is meat. Meat is ok to eat as long as it's organic and high-quality. Most of the available meat is such low-quality I would say it's not even worth buying. The best meat you can get is probably wild-caught fish. Tuna, Salmon, and Halibut are probably the best tasting but are certainly more expensive. You can eat some shrimp but I wouldn't eat too much. And you can also eat scallops which I think are healthy for you. The next best meat is organic chicken, and the worst is red meat. You can eat anything you want including some red meat but I would recommend eating more fish over chicken and beef and eating more chicken over beef. Also you should be eating more vegetables and plants than meat. Meat should only be a small part of your diet and I wouldn't even recommend you eat it every day. On the other hand, I believe you should be eating eggs every day and always eat eggs over meat. I think eggs are a better source of protein and nutrition than any meat that's out there including fish. 
The extra food that you can eat as snacks is the "Prana Snack Mixes"(40). They're good if you're at work or out and just want to snack on something crunchy and salty. They also have sweeter mixes so you can pick whatever flavor you want. 
All the food products that I mentioned are available at Healthy Planet and Fortino's. Your lucky that you're close to two Fortino locations, so if one place is sold out on a food product, you can check out the other location. You don't have to buy everything at once and stock up. You can stock up on dried food goods like rice, pasta, quinoa, lentils, tea, etc. Never stock up on organic fruits or vegetables. Organic food becomes rotten much quicker than conventional food. Organic produce should not be kept in your fridge for a long time. They start going bad only after a few days and you must eat it all up before that happens. If you stock up and don't finish the food, you will end up throwing it away and waste your money. This is why I recommend to only buy what you need for the next 2-3 days and you have to go grocery shopping more often. This is the other downside of organic food other than it being more expensive. The upside you get for your health is worth the downsides that come along with organic food. 
Summary of Foods to Eat:
Eat organic fruits and vegetables, cook your food with butter or ghee, only eat gluten-free roti/pasta, make and eat amazing salads, eat starchy foods like potatoes and rice, Beans and Chickpeas can be added to any dish or you can make them into sabzis, Lentils can be added to any dish or made into dal, only eat gluten-free bread, Organic nachos are ok but be careful what you add in them, eat eggs cooked in butter or ghee, eat only gluten-free noodles, make homemade broth for soups, only buy chicken, beef, and goat meat from Blossom Pure, only buy wild-caught fish, if you want to eat out only eat at a sushi restaurant. 
If there are any questions you have about what I talked about or questions about any other food I didn't mention, feel free to ask and I'll give you my opinion. 
Section 5 - When to eat/fasting
Timing of the types of food you eat during the day is essential. The reason is because of how our metabolism works. Notice when you eat a heavy cooked meal you start feeling tired? That's because our bodies are designed to eat heavy-cooked meals at the end of the day before we go to sleep. By eating a heavy meal that's cooked during the day, it over-burdens your digestive system and you will more likely end up storing the food as fat. Raw foods and liquids, on the other hand, have the opposite effect. They are easier to digest, don't burden your metabolism, and give you energy throughout the day, and helps you burn fat. 
During the morning and daytime: drink more liquids and eat raw food:
Water, Teas, Smoothies, Juices, and Kombucha.
Eat salad during the daytime, if you want to add something cooked like an egg or a little meat in the salad, that's ok too. 
Eat snacks like the Prana trail mixes or other nuts and seeds. You can even eat Giggy Yoyo dark chocolate.
You can also snack on tortilla chips and salsa during the daytime. 
Eat raw fruits
Only eat heavy cooked meals at nighttime for your dinner. It's ok to have a huge dinner and eat as much as you want, especially if you're hungry. This is the time to eat:
Sabzis, Pasta, Quinoa, Potatoes, Rice, Eggs, Meat, Lentils, Bread, Noodles, Soups, Nachos, etc.
Only drink water with such cooked meals. 
By separating the different types of food and eating them during different times of the day. You put your body in the best situation where it can burn fat and lose weight. 
There are two ways you can approach this method of eating. One is by eating a lot of food, and the other is eating less which is called intermitted-fasting. If you want to eat a lot I would recommend something like this:
Tea, smoothie, juice, or kombucha in the morning with salad.
Have a second salad meal with a different drink later on in the day.
Prepare and eat whatever dinner you feel like eating that night. 
The disadvantage of this method is it will take longer to lose weight because you're not giving your digestive system much of a break. Only when our stomachs are empty and we feel hungry, we are burning fat at a high rate. This leads me to the second method of eating, which is controlled hunger or intermitted-fasting. When your stomach is empty and your body is working, you switch on systems of energy in your body that don't turn on when there is food in your stomach. These systems burn fat and create energy for the body. If you want your metabolism to work in peak condition, you must put your body through periods of hunger and allow your system to burn excess fat in your body. A diet based on intermitted-fasting looks something like this:
Only liquids during the day, and less than a handful of snacks. If you must eat something only have a salad that doesn't have any cooked or heavy ingredients. 
Eat one big meal at the end of the day for dinner. If you eat this way, you are not restricted to any food. You can eat anything that's part of the diet plan, and as much of it as you want for dinner.
This intermitted diet plan that I explained above is the main diet plan I follow for myself. Everybody is different and this plan might not work for you. This is why you must try many different foods and try different ways to eat them. You have to figure out for yourself what foods you like to eat best and when, and how you want to eat them. It's a journey that will take several months to discover, but in the end, you will become a thinner and healthier person from all the effort you put into yourself. 
Section 6 - Supplements
The final section in this essay is all about supplements. Supplements are just like food, there are a lot of low-quality products out there that aren't even worth your money. These companies don't care about making a quality product and only want to make money selling cheap vitamins. I would put a company like Jamieson in that category. The good news is there are companies out there that have done good research and formulated supplements that are good for your health and worth buying. 
I'm not going into details about why certain supplements are bad and why others are better. There's a lot of information on that subject and you don't need to know that right now. Out of all the research and experiments that I've done, I've concluded that if you take these supplements, they will give you all the nutrition your body needs. That doesn't mean you can live off these things. Your body is designed to eat real food and you have to eat to get complete nutrition. The problem with food is you have no idea if you're getting all the nutrients you need from the meal you're eating. By taking supplements along with your meals, you can guarantee that you are getting all the nutrition you need from your meal. I believe the following list of supplements will complete the nutrition profile in your Diet:
Flora Daily Maintenance Enzymes(41)
Now Red Mineral Algae(42)
Progressive Muti-Vitamin for Women(43)
Sunforce Krill Oil(44)
Progressive Whey-Essential All-in-One(45)
Flora Adult's Probiotic(46)
Supplements can get expensive and all the supplements I mentioned cost around $250. They will last you for 3 months so the cost is around $20 a week or $3 a day. You technically don't need those supplements and it's possible to lose weight without them. If you take them, however, you will see your weight loss occur much quicker. I would recommend taking them right before a meal and taking the probiotic right after your meal. There are more types of supplements you can take but you don't need to learn about those yet. Try the ones I recommend and ask about more if you like them. You don't have to buy all of them at once and can buy them one at a time. Everybody is different and you might not like taking the supplements at all. Or you might decide that only one is good enough for you like the probiotic or muti-vitamin. You have to try it out and decide for yourself what you like and don't like. 
Summary of Supplements:
Take digestive enzymes before each cooked meal. You don't need to take them with raw food or drinks. Take the remaining supplements in proper doses before each meal as you desire. Take the probiotic after each good-sized meal. 
The final thing I would recommend is getting a biotin/collagen shampoo for your hair. I believe this is the best shampoo you can get for your hair and I personally use one to great results(47).
That's the end of my Diet Plan Theory and all my recommendations. Please take time to read over all the information so you can fully understand everything. Trying to do everything at once is hard, only select a few things that interest you the most and start with that. Slowly start buying more of the food and supplements and keep trying different variety of food. Come back and reference this essay to find the information you need for your diet. I hope this essay will help inspire you to take control of your food, your weight, and your health. It's not easy, but if you work hard and dedicate yourself to this, you will see many good benefits for your body and health and it will last the rest of your life.

- **Neural Connectivity**: Enhanced neural connectivity and brain plasticity during the trip may facilitate access to a broader network intelligence.
- **Temporary Access**: Users might temporarily tap into a shared network of information or consciousness, leading to profound insights and visual experiences.
- **Loss of Access**: After the psychedelic effects wear off, the altered brain state returns to normal, closing the connection to this network intelligence and resulting in the loss of the newly accessed information.

**Evidence**:
- **Neural Imaging**: Studies show increased connectivity and synchronized brain activity during psychedelic experiences.
- **Subjective Reports**: Users often report accessing profound, seemingly external sources of information or experiencing unity with the universe.

#### Theory 2: Generation of Information Packets

**Mechanism**:
- **Chemical Effects**: Similar alterations in brain chemistry and connectivity.
- **Brain Plasticity**: The brain's heightened malleability allows for the creation of new neural pathways and information packets.
- **Internal Generation**: Unknown forces, potentially a deeper layer of brain function or quantum processes within neurons, generate new packets of information.
- **Retention and Loss**: These packets provide novel insights and visuals during the trip but gradually dissipate as the brain returns to its baseline state.

**Evidence**:
- **Neuroplasticity**: Psychedelics are known to increase neuroplasticity, supporting the idea of temporary new pathways.
- **Cognitive Effects**: Users often experience lasting changes in perception and thought patterns, though the specifics of the trip fade.

### Comparison and Evaluation

**Access to Network Intelligence**:
- **Pros**: Explains the sense of external, profound knowledge and unity reported by users.
- **Cons**: Difficult to empirically prove the existence of an external network or shared consciousness.

**Generation of Information Packets**:
- **Pros**: Aligns with current understanding of brain plasticity and neurochemical effects.
- **Cons**: Lessens the mystical aspect of the experience, viewing it as an internal brain process rather than an external connection.

### Conclusion

Both theories offer compelling explanations for the nature of psychedelic experiences. **Access to network intelligence** aligns with subjective reports of interconnectedness and external knowledge, while **generation of information packets** fits well with neuroscientific findings on brain plasticity and connectivity. Further research, possibly incorporating advanced neuroimaging and studies on long-term cognitive effects, is needed to better understand the intricate dynamics of psychedelic experiences and their implications for our understanding of consciousness and unknown forces.

### Combining Theories for Psychedelic Experiences

### Access to Network Intelligence and Information Packets

The integration of both theories can offer a logical explanation for psychedelic experiences. Here's how they merge:

**Subconscious as Networked Intelligence**:
- **Mechanism**: The subconscious mind retains a vast amount of information and patterns not accessible during regular conscious states.
- **Psychedelic Access**: Psychedelics alter brain chemistry, potentially reducing the barriers between the conscious and subconscious minds.
- **Temporary Access**: During a psychedelic experience, users access a networked intelligence, which is actually the wealth of information stored in the subconscious.

**Generation of Information Packets as Emerging Patterns**:
- **Mechanism**: The increased brain plasticity and connectivity under psychedelics allow for new connections to form rapidly.
- **Emerging Patterns**: These connections manifest as information packets, which are novel insights or patterns emerging from the subconscious data.

**Unified Explanation**:
- **Combined Effects**: Psychedelics provide access to the subconscious (networked intelligence) and facilitate the creation of new neural pathways (information packets).
- **Novel Experiences**: The interplay between accessing deep-seated subconscious knowledge and generating new connections creates the profound, often mystical experiences reported by users.
- **Post-Trip Retention**: While the heightened access diminishes post-trip, the new connections and insights may influence long-term cognition and perception.

### Implications

This integrated theory suggests that psychedelics serve as a bridge to deeper, subconscious intelligence, facilitating profound insights by revealing and reorganizing existing subconscious data into new, meaningful patterns. This approach offers a logical framework that aligns with both neuroscientific findings and subjective reports of psychedelic experiences.

### The Role of Networked Intelligence in Historical Contexts

### Terence McKenna's Stoned Ape Theory
- **Theory Overview**: McKenna proposed that early humans ingested psychedelic mushrooms, which played a crucial role in the evolution of human consciousness and higher-ordered intelligence.
- **Mechanism**: Psychedelics enhanced visual acuity, promoted social bonding, and increased cognitive flexibility, potentially accelerating linguistic and cultural development.

### Altered States and Access to Networked Intelligence
