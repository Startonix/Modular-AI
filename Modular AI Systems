where A^t is the advantage estimate, and œµ\epsilonœµ is a hyperparameter that controls the clipping range.

7. Monte Carlo Simulations
Variance Reduction Techniques
Mathematical Model: Techniques such as stratified sampling and antithetic variates reduce the variance of Monte Carlo estimates.
I^=n1i=1‚àënp(xi)f(xi)

where xi are samples drawn from a probability distribution p(x), and f(x) is the function being integrated.

8. Streaming Data Processing
