where A^t is the advantage estimate, and œµ\epsilonœµ is a hyperparameter that controls the clipping range.

7. Monte Carlo Simulations
Variance Reduction Techniques
Mathematical Model: Techniques such as stratified sampling and antithetic variates reduce the variance of Monte Carlo estimates.
I^=n1i=1‚àënp(xi)f(xi)

where xi are samples drawn from a probability distribution p(x), and f(x) is the function being integrated.

8. Streaming Data Processing
Apache Kafka
Mathematical Model: Handles high-throughput, low-latency data streams using distributed commit logs.

### Complex Neuromorphic Processing Code Integrated with Machine Learning

Below is a more complex neuromorphic processing code that directly integrates with a major machine learning component, such as a recurrent neural network (RNN). This example demonstrates how neuromorphic processing can be combined with a machine learning model to enhance learning and inference capabilities.

#### Step 1: Define the Neuromorphic Network

Using Nengo, a popular library for neuromorphic simulations, we define a neuromorphic network that processes input data and integrates with an RNN.

```python
import nengo
import numpy as np

def create_neuromorphic_network(input_signal, dimensions=1, neurons=100):
    model = nengo.Network()
    with model:
        input_node = nengo.Node(output=input_signal)
        ens = nengo.Ensemble(neurons, dimensions)
        nengo.Connection(input_node, ens)
        output_probe = nengo.Probe(ens, synapse=0.01)
    return model, output_probe

def run_neuromorphic_simulation(model, duration=1.0):
    with nengo.Simulator(model) as sim:
        sim.run(duration)
    return sim
```

#### Step 2: Define the Machine Learning Component (RNN)

Using TensorFlow to define an RNN that processes the output from the neuromorphic network.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_rnn_model(input_shape):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNN(50, activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model
```

#### Step 3: Integrate Neuromorphic Processing with RNN

Simulate the neuromorphic network and feed its output into the RNN for further processing and learning.

```python
def neuromorphic_input_signal(t):
    return np.sin(2 * np.pi * t)

# Create neuromorphic network
neuromorphic_model, neuromorphic_probe = create_neuromorphic_network(neuromorphic_input_signal)

# Run neuromorphic simulation
neuromorphic_sim = run_neuromorphic_simulation(neuromorphic_model, duration=1.0)

# Get output from neuromorphic network
neuromorphic_output = neuromorphic_sim.data[neuromorphic_probe]

# Reshape the output for RNN input
rnn_input = neuromorphic_output.reshape((neuromorphic_output.shape[0], 1, neuromorphic_output.shape[1]))

# Create and train RNN model
rnn_model = create_rnn_model((1, neuromorphic_output.shape[1]))
rnn_model.fit(rnn_input, np.random.randint(10, size=(neuromorphic_output.shape[0],)), epochs=5)
```

### Advanced Example: Combining Neuromorphic Processing with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

For a more complex integration, we can combine neuromorphic processing with a CNN, commonly used for image processing tasks.

    model = nengo.Network()
    with model:
        input_node = nengo.Node(output=input_image)
        ens = nengo.Ensemble(neurons, dimensions)
        nengo.Connection(input_node, ens)
        output_probe = nengo.Probe(ens, synapse=0.01)
    return model, output_probe

def run_image_neuromorphic_simulation(model, duration=0.1):
    with nengo.Simulator(model) as sim:
        sim.run(duration)
    return sim
```

#### Define the CNN Component

```python
def create_cnn_model(input_shape):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
        tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
        tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model
```

#### Integrate Neuromorphic Processing with CNN

```python
# Example input image (28x28 pixels)
input_image = np.random.rand(28, 28)

# Flatten image for neuromorphic network
flattened_image = input_image.flatten()

# Create neuromorphic network for image preprocessing
image_neuromorphic_model, image_neuromorphic_probe = create_image_neuromorphic_network(flattened_image)

# Run neuromorphic simulation for image
image_neuromorphic_sim = run_image_neuromorphic_simulation(image_neuromorphic_model, duration=0.1)

# Get output from neuromorphic network and reshape for CNN input
neuromorphic_image_output = image_neuromorphic_sim.data[image_neuromorphic_probe]
reshaped_output = neuromorphic_image_output[-1].reshape((28, 28, 1))

# Create and train CNN model
cnn_model = create_cnn_model((28, 28, 1))
cnn_model.fit(reshaped_output[np.newaxis, ...], np.array([1]), epochs=5)
```
